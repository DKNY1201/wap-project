1.	Problem of statement

In US, public transportation is not readily available in all the cities. So, people have to either go in their own car or look for a ride from a friend or relative. This gets pretty expensive for most of the people and the ride is not available always. To ease the life of people in these cities, we are going to develop a system called Chalo Chalo in car that will help people to post about their travel plans and offer rides to those who needs.Also, people who need rides can look on the website and book the ride if it’s available for their preferred day and time. This functionality will help in cost cutting of both the rider and the fellow passenger and ease their lives. This will also help in building connections between different and diverse people.

       2.  Objective

Chalo Chalo in car system will offer a platform for the people who want to offer the ride and for those who want to use the offered ride. The people who offer the ride will be beneficial in terms of cost sharing and of course avoid loneliness while traveling long distance as passenger will be a good accompany. At the same time, the people who takes the ride can get a cheap ride, easy travel, and avoid the public transportation hussel.
